# BluePrism-CodeSnippets-VBO
This repository contains a collection of custom code snippets and scripts designed for use within the Code Stage of Blue Prism processes. These scripts provide extended functionality and utilities that can be leveraged to create powerful, reusable Visual Business Objects (VBOs). The code snippets are organized by category and are intended to help Blue Prism developers enhance their automation projects.

Features:
Custom Code Snippets: Ready-to-use scripts for a variety of use cases, such as string manipulation, data conversion, file handling, and more.
Reusable VBOs: Pre-built Visual Business Objects that can be easily integrated into your Blue Prism projects.
Documentation & Examples: Each script is accompanied by a description and usage example to help you understand how to implement it in your automation workflows.
Contribution:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit your own code snippets or suggest improvements to existing ones. Let's build a robust library of utilities for the Blue Prism community together.

Disclaimer:
These scripts are provided as-is and should be thoroughly tested in a non-production environment before use in live processes.
